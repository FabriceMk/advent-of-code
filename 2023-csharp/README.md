# 2023-csharp

This is just a prototype of the first day solution of the 2023 AoC in C# to prepare the one for next year.

## Prerequisites

- **.NET 8**: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0

## How to run

You can run the solution for a particular day with the following command:

```
dotnet run --project /day{dayNumber}/day{dayNumber}.csproj {1|2}
dotnet run --project /day4/day4.csproj 1   # Runs part 1 of the day 4
dotnet run --project /day6/day6.csproj 2   # Runs part 2 of the day 6
```

or directly from one of the day subfolders
```
dotnet run {1|2}
dotnet run 1 # Runs part 1 of the day
dotnet run 2 # Runs part 2 of the day
```
