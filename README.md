# advent-of-code

Repository for annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges.

Each year has its dedicated folder.

## Languages and rules used for each year

### 2023

- Language: [Golang](https://go.dev/)
- Forbidden to install any external dependency (except for the test files).
- Use less regexp as possible (for small parsings), this aspect is not the one that interests me this year.
- Try to avoid cryptic hacks when possible like bit flipping and other kind of Dark Magic.
- Depending on my mood, each puzzle can have different self-imposed rules like:
  - Trying to avoid too many nested loops
  - Solve the problem in one pass when parsing the input
  - Try to go for a fast solution even if it has more hardcoded stuff
  - Go for a simple and elegant solution that puts emphasis on future collaboration and is easy-to-read
  - etc...
